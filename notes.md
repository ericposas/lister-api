## Notes
- So, in PHP frameworks (esp. in API routing), the Dependency Container is meant to set up dependencies for use within the Controllers
- Should really move business logic out of the controllers, by creating a "Service" layer and placing the logic there -- This is essentially moving the business logic to the Entity ExtendedRespositories class
